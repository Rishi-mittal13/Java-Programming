//167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

//NOTE:- GIVEN APPROACH IS CALLED TWO POINTER APPROACH AND IT IS BEST QUESTION FOR TWO POINTER APPROACH.
//IN TWO POINTER APPROACH WE APPROACH A ELEMENT FROM STAR INDEX AND LAST INDEX TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC PAIR.
//THERE ARE ONE CONDITION IN TWO POINTER APPROACH IS THAT ARRAY SHOULD BE SORTED.
